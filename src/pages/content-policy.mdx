## Guiding Principles

<div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-8 my-12">

<div class="bg-surface-elevated/50 backdrop-blur-sm p-8 rounded-3xl border border-surface-border">

### Legal and Safe

All items and services must comply with local, state, and federal laws. Items that could pose safety risks should include appropriate warnings and safety information.

</div>

<div class="bg-surface-elevated/50 backdrop-blur-sm p-8 rounded-3xl border border-surface-border">

### Honest and Accurate

Descriptions should be truthful and complete. Share both the strengths and limitations of what you're offering. Building trust means being transparent.

</div>

<div class="bg-surface-elevated/50 backdrop-blur-sm p-8 rounded-3xl border border-surface-border">

### Community-Focused

We prioritize small-scale, local commerce and authentic human connections. Mass-produced items from major retailers don't fit our mission, but local small businesses absolutely do.

</div>

<div class="bg-surface-elevated/50 backdrop-blur-sm p-8 rounded-3xl border border-surface-border">

### Respectful

Items and services should respect the dignity and wellbeing of all people. Content that promotes harm, hatred, or exploitation has no place here.
