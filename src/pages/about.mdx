# About

## Origins

{platformName} was started in late 2025 with the goal of reducing the time, pain, and friction experienced every time we go to make a large purchase on the used market. We want to use the benefits of modern technology to optimize the experience of connecting local buyers and sellers. We also want to help find new homes for used items that still have plenty of life in them.

## What Makes Us Different

### The Request System

Many online marketplaces are built around listings of items for sale. We want to build a market that serves the needs of **both** buyers **and** sellers. Our request system allows buyers to post what they are interested in, so they don't have to wait around for someone else to post that thing they are looking for.

### Personal Connections

No one likes feeds full of spam or receive pesky messages from scammers. We want to build a platform filled with trustworthy people connected by real-life relationships. Our invite-only system means that we can present you with a complete chain of relationships that connect you to anyone else on the platform that reaches out about an item. You have full control to interact with an incoming request or ignore it.

### Everyday Redemption

We want to take a stand against materialism and consumerism. Every day, countless items are thrown out with plenty of useful life left. This is wasteful, unsustainable, and short-sighted. It is our desire that this market could provide a sort of everyday redemption for the things you no longer need. Instead of throwing things out, why not try finding someone in your local community who could make good use of it?
