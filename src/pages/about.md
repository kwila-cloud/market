## Our Story

I created this platform because I needed it myself—and I believe others will find it valuable too.

Finding high-quality items on the used market often takes far too much time and effort. I wanted to change that. As someone who enjoys attending auctions and shopping at surplus and thrift stores, I've seen firsthand how rewarding it can be to discover hidden treasures. I wanted to build a platform that makes this experience accessible to everyone while helping people connect along the way.

I also heard from small business owners who want an online catalog or portfolio but don't want to invest in a dedicated website or spend countless hours setting up shop on existing marketplaces that take a cut of every transaction. They needed a simpler, fairer solution.

## What Makes Us Different

### The Request System
Our request system makes it incredibly easy to put out a request for something you're looking for. Instead of endlessly scrolling through listings, you can tell the community what you need—and let sellers come to you.

### High-Trust, Personal Connections
We're focused on building personal connections and relationships. We want a high-trust marketplace, not a platform overrun by spam and scammers like some of the existing options. Real people, real items, real relationships.

### Second Chances Over Landfills
My Christian worldview means I strongly value humans over material things. It's very important to me that this market serves people well while also being anti-materialistic. We should seek to find useful second chances for our items rather than throwing them in landfills and always buying marked-up brand new things that quickly lose their shine.

**Our core values:**
- Humans are eternal, the things we buy and sell are not.
- Relationships have lasting value, profit margins do not.
- Quality is worth far more than quantity.
